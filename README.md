# TimeLock
This is a work in process project for controlling kids time on computers

Cloud Server would solve a lot of the administration and granular configuration
For now, the compiling would require that the TimeLock exe is part of the Run in the registry in Regedit for windows

# Add Admin form to adjust time
# If computer is restarted, Timer should continue from where it started
	- if the time is finished and windows is restarted, lock screen should be immediate
	- if time not finished, than timer should continue counting down from where it stopped.
# Make the program resilient to being shutdown from Task Manager
# Add functionality to extend time
# Build iOS App to control computers
	- connection to cloud to store remaining time
	- will open multiple capabilities to add calendars and more tailored time restriction
	

**Installation**
Install python (i did the dev in VSCode free from microsoft)
  - install tk library: pip install tk
